# Graph inference and unsupervised model selection
Data and codes for  Workshop paper:  Soundscape Connectomes: Graph-Based Perspectives for Unsupervised Soundscape Mapping  

We provide code to (a) infer graphs from acoustic feature matrices and (b) perform unsupervised model selection  
Outputs include adjacency matrices, metrics, and the scripts to reproduce the figures reported in the paper.
